# atomix-jepsen

[Atomix][atomix] [Jepsen][jepsen] tests.

## Overview

atomix-jepsen is a suite of [Jepsen][jepsen] based tests for [Atomix][atomix] including:

* Linearizable CAS

The tests are run against various nemeses including:

* Partition with random halves
* Partition a random isolated node
* Partition in half with a bridge node
* Crash a random set of nodes
* Randomize the clock on all nodes

## Setup

To run atomix-jepsen you'll need to setup a Jepsen test environment. If you don't already have one, you can create one using Docker. First, clone atomix-jepsen:

```
git clone https://github.com/atomix/atomix-jepsen.git
```

Then create a jepsen Docker container, sharing your `atomix-jepsen` directory into the container:

```
cd atomix-jepsen
docker run --privileged --name jepsen -it -v $(pwd):/atomix-jepsen jhalterman/jepsen
```
This jepsen container will include 5 [docker-in-docker](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind) sub-containers in which Atomix will be deployed.

## Usage

To run the atomix-jepsen tests, from your `atomix-jepsen` directory, run:

```
lein test
```

To run a single test (ex):

```
lein test :only atomix-jepsen.dvalue-test/bridge
```

## Notes

#### Shared Repository

To cut down on test setup time and disk usage, you can share your local `~/.m2` directory with your Jepsen environment by including the following in your `docker run` command:

```
-v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2
```

#### Skip Build

To use Atomix from your local `.m2` repo instead of pulling and building it from Github, run as:

```
DEV=true lein test
```

#### Orphaned Processes

If you break out of a running test, the java processes that maintain SSH sessions to your jepsen nodes may be left running, as well as the atomix server processes on those nodes. To kill these, run `pkill java` from your jepsen container.
